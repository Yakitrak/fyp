# PyParson [FYP]


## What are Parson's Puzzles?
Parson's Puzzles are a way to practice programming logic and syntax. Instead of writing a program from scratch, you are given a small program but the lines are in a random order. You have to reposition the lines to make the program work correctly. It is an efficient method to practice and revise programming concepts.

## What is PyParson?
PyParson uses Parson's puzzles which are proven to be very useful. But unlike other applications, you sign up to keep track of your progress. PyParson will use a smart algorithm to monitor your skills in different areas of programming and only give questions which are personalised to challenge you. 

This is my final year project for my Bsc(Hons) Software Engineering course. I hope it will help students independently improve on their weaknesses and getting a better understanding of programming concepts. The latest stable version of this repository is live [here](http://kjfyp.ddns.net).
